# Call-Center-Performance-Analysis-Dashboard
# Overview
The Call Center Dashboard project aims to analyze and visualize key performance indicators (KPIs) for a call center using Power BI. The dashboard provides insights into customer satisfaction, call handling efficiency, and agent performance, helping stakeholders make data-driven decisions.
# Data Source
This dataset was gotten from Deloitte [01 Call-Center-Dataset.xlsx](https://github.com/user-attachments/files/18942264/01.Call-Center-Dataset.xlsx)

# Key Performance Indicators (KPIs)

1. Overall Customer Satisfaction: Measures the percentage of customers satisfied with the service.

2. Overall Calls Answered/Abandoned: Tracks the number of calls handled versus those abandoned, and helps in assessing call center efficiency and staffing needs.

3. Calls by Time: Visualizes call volume trends over different time periods, and helps in identifying peak hours and optimizing resource allocation.

4. Average Speed of Answer: Measures the average time taken to answer calls, and lower value indicates better responsiveness.

5. Number of Calls Answered: Categorizes agents into performance quadrants for better workforce management.
